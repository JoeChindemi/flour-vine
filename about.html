    <p class="fvStory">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flour & Vine is a new-age Philadelphia pizzaria taking the city by storm.  It was founded in 2022 by current owner Joe Chindemi, 
      a Drexel Student who decided to follow a lifelong dream of his and open his own resturaunt.  The concept of Flour & Vine was simple: make quality wine 
      and quality pizza for the students and people of Philadelphia.</p>
    <p class="fvConcept">Flour & Vine has a classic menu that only includes two things: pizza and wine.  Although our pies and wines are simple, they are some of 
    the best around town.  Our famous grandma slice has become a hit around University City, and everybody can't stop raving about the Merlot.  We hope you can stop by and enjoy a bite or a sip!
